It was a quiet summer morning when Laura decided to take a walk along the tree-lined avenue near her home. The sun filtered through the leaves, casting soft shadows on the sidewalk. Passersby walked slowlyâ€”some with their dogs, others holding a steaming cup of coffee in their hands. The air smelled of linden and freshly baked bread. Laura paused for a moment in front of the bookstore window, drawn by a colorful cover depicting a field of blooming poppies. She went in, driven by curiosity, and was immediately embraced by the hushed silence typical of places filled with stories. She leafed through some books, reading a few lines here and there, then headed to the Italian fiction section. She chose a novel set in Tuscany, drawn by the description of the landscape and its characters. As she stepped outside, the sky was clearer, and a light breeze stirred the balcony curtains. On her way home, she thought about how precious those quiet little moments were, far from the daily rush. Once she arrived, she sat on the sofa, opened the book, and began to read, letting herself began carried away by the story as if she were, part of it.
